### Deliverables
1. **List and status of deliverables**: (See the relevant links above)
1. **A summary of the project status and any changes that are planned for moving forward**:
 Our 6-person team is still making great progress on the Buchess Social project. Chess has turned out to be a goldmine for user engagement - there's so much more we can do with strategy tips, forums, leaderboards, and live game analysis. The interface needs some polish to make it more user-friendly, and we want to build up the community features. We're keeping our ears open for user feedback to make sure we're on the right track and can pivot if needed.
3. **UX design with focus on domain-specific nature of the features.**
    - We designed our UI and selected our theme to maximize readability.
    - We display comments in chronological order.
    - Each comment (annotating a move) can be found under that exact move.
5. **Description of the standard being utilized (with examples)**
    - We decided on Web Annotation Data Model standard. We written documentation [here](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group12/wiki/Web-Annotation-Data-Model-(WADM)-Documentation). We couldn't implement the standard in our yet.
7. **API Documentation**
Our 'current' API Documentation always available at https://buchessocial.online/api/swagger or swagger.json/yaml but due to this is our current deployment link, here is the latest version before milestone 2 report deadline [at this github link](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group12/blob/main/reports/api_doc.yaml)
You can easily see the UI also by pasting this yaml file into [swagger-editor](https://editor.swagger.io).
### Testing 
- The general test plan for our project involves a phased testing strategy. Initially, we have implemented unit tests for the backend and frontend components separately to ensure individual modules function as expected. Moving forward, we plan to extend our testing efforts to include integration testing to verify interactions between components and use mock data to simulate real-world scenarios. This progressive approach ensures a robust and reliable product.


- **Backend:** 
    - **Unit Testing:**
        Implemented and ran tests for key backend components across multiple apps:
        - Posts: Verified like_post and filter_games endpoints, handling pagination warnings gracefully.
        - Games: Tested add_game_comment and list_game_comments endpoints for authenticated and unauthenticated users.
        - Accounts: Covered user authentication and management functionalities.
        - Healthcheck: Validated general, database, and authenticated health checks.

    - **Test Execution Summary:**

        - Posts: 11 tests passed in 2.6 seconds.
        - Games: 3 tests passed in 0.25 seconds.
        - Accounts: 6 tests passed in 1.4 seconds.
        - Healthcheck: 4 tests passed in 1.17 seconds.
        - **Total: All 24 tests passed successfully.**
    
    - **Test Workflow:**

        Tests executed using Docker (at app/backend):
        ```
        docker-compose exec web bash test.sh
        ```
        Leveraged the `test_chess` database for isolated testing environments.

    
- **Frontend:**
    - Unit tests implemented for home page. The test suite validates the following functionality:
        - The HomeCard displays appropriate views based on user authentication status and performs necessary health checks for logged-in users.
        - For Feed functionality, tests ensure posts render with their associated like counts and SharePost visibility adapts to user authentication state.
        - Post component tests verify content rendering, user interactions like liking and deleting posts, and proper chess position display when FEN notation is present.
         - SharePost validation covers form elements, submission handling, content type support including images and chess positions, and tag management. The tests also verify proper feedback through success messages and preview functionality.
    - Run the test suite with:
    ```npm test```
    - Test summary (failures will be fixed urgently):
        - Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
        - Tests:       6 failed, 10 passed, 16 total
        - Snapshots:   0 total
        - Time:        10.129 s
        - Ran all test suites.
- **Mobile:**
    - LikeButton test verifies if the like button displays the correct initial count and heart icon state based on provided props.
    - AuthService test verifies that the login method successfully authenticates a user with valid credentials and returns a user object.
    - LikeService test checks if the toggleLike method properly switches a post's like status and updates the like count.
    - AuthContext test verifies that the AuthContext provides null user and empty error states on initial render.
    - PgnViewer test checks that a chess game's details (players, event, date) are correctly displayed when given valid PGN notation.
    - ThemedText test verifies that text colors adjust appropriately based on the device's light/dark theme setting.
    - LoginScreen test checks that invalid email formats trigger appropriate validation error messages.
    - CreatePostScreen test verifies that all form elements (title, content, image upload) are properly rendered.
    - MasterGameService test checks that a chess game's PGN notation is successfully retrieved using a valid game ID.
        
    - Run the test suite with:
    ```npm test```
    
    - Test summary (failures will be fixed urgently):
        - Test Suites: 9 failed, 2 passed, 11 total
        - Tests:       3 failed, 7 passed, 10 total
        - Snapshots:   0 total
        - Time:        1.528 s, estimated 3 s

    - Screenshots: [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/bounswe/projects/83/views/4)




### Evaluation
1. **Evaluation of the status of deliverables and its impact on our project plan:**
    - We are not able to follow our initial plan for the deliverables. Some of our features remain implemented mostly due to the lack of enough team members. We have re-evaluated what we could do with two people in each team and tried to produce the most critical parts and keeping the app coherent. We will continue to try picking up the most important parts of our project to provide the best experience with the resources we have.
3. **A summary of the customer feedback and reflections**:
    - There should be a comment downvote feature.
    - There should be a comment report feature.
    - There should be a position analysis feature.
    - The user should be able to see all the comments for the game, not just the comments for each move.
    - There should be more complex search for games between Player A and Player B, or games with opening A, or games between years A and B.
    - There should be hyperlinks on tournament name, player name, etc. to jump to either (1) a wiki page or (2) a search result with that keyword.
5. **Evaluation of tools and processes you have used to manage your team project**:

**Evaluation of Tools**

* **GitHub**
We've relied heavily on GitHub as our main platform for sharing and collaborating on code. We use its features like issue tracking, project boards, and wikis to stay organized and efficient. By using issue tracking, we’ve managed tasks effectively and quickly addressed any project-related challenges. Our team uses the wiki to centralize documentation, making it easy for everyone to access and share project resources. Overall, GitHub has helped us streamline our workflow and improve collaboration.

* **Docker**
We’ve used Docker extensively to create consistent development environments across all team members' machines. By standardizing our setups, we’ve avoided environment-specific issues and made our development process more reliable. We also use Docker Compose to configure and automate the deployment of multiple services, such as our backend and database. This approach ensures that our development and production environments are always aligned, making our workflow smoother and more predictable.

* **Swagger**
To document our APIs, we’ve integrated Swagger into our project. We use Swagger to provide the frontend and mobile teams with a clear and interactive overview of all API endpoints. This has made it easier for us to align development efforts and minimize communication gaps. We’ve also explored tools like DRF-Spectacular and DRF-YASG to further enhance our documentation and make it more comprehensive and user-friendly.

* **DigitalOcean**
For deployment, we use DigitalOcean to host our backend and database services. We’ve set up a secure production environment with HTTPS support and configured firewall rules to protect our application. DigitalOcean allows us to scale resources based on project needs, and by integrating Docker, we’ve automated the deployment process. This has helped us maintain a secure and reliable environment for our application.

* **Google Drive & Docs**
We rely on Google Docs and Drive for creating, organizing, and storing all our project documentation. We use Google Docs to collaborate on meeting notes, research documents, and other materials, ensuring that everyone stays on the same page. By organizing everything in Google Drive, we’ve made it easy to access project resources and avoid losing important information. This approach has helped us maintain consistency and quality in our documentation.

* **Postman**
We use Postman regularly to test and validate our API endpoints. It allows us to simulate different request scenarios and debug issues efficiently. By working with Postman, we’ve ensured that our backend is reliable and performs as expected under various conditions.

* **WhatsApp**
When we need to communicate quickly, we rely on WhatsApp. It’s been an essential tool for addressing urgent issues or clarifying points during emergencies. With WhatsApp, we’ve been able to stay connected and resolve problems promptly, ensuring our project stays on track.

**Evaluation of Processes**

* **Team Meetings**
Our team held regular meetings at Lab sessions. These meetings were crucial for discussing weekly tasks, reviewing project progress, and addressing any challenges faced by team members. Before each meeting, we outlined the lab topics and estimated the time required for each topic to ensure that meetings remained focused and did not overrun. Meeting notes, including key takeaways and assigned tasks, were documented and shared via Google Docs to maintain transparency and reference.

* **Issue Management**
We managed our project workflow through GitHub’s issue management system. During our meetings, we broke down tasks and assigned them to team members by creating detailed issues in the GitHub repository. For larger tasks, we created sub-issues to make them more manageable. Each issue was given a title, description, acceptance criteria, and reviewers, ensuring clear expectations. We also used labels to prioritize and categorize tasks, which helped streamline organization and made task management more efficient for the entire team.

* **GitHub Roadmap**
We utilized GitHub's roadmap feature to plan and track the progress of our project milestones. During our initial planning sessions, we outlined key deliverables and created roadmap items to represent them. Each item was linked to specific issues and tasks in the repository, ensuring seamless tracking. We assigned due dates and team members to roadmap items, allowing us to monitor progress and stay aligned with project goals. The roadmap provided a visual overview of our development timeline, helping us prioritize tasks effectively and adapt to changes as needed. This approach kept the entire team informed and focused on achieving milestones on schedule.

### Orhan Ünüvar
1. **Responsibilities**: I was responsible for testing the mobile application by writing unit tests for the various components and also manually testing all the features through both a real iOS device and an Android emulator. Additionally, I was responsible for building the mobile application for the Android platform by generating an .apk file.
2. **Main contributions**:
- I wrote unit tests for the various components of the mobile application, some of which were the login screen, the create post screen, the like button, and the PGN viewer. I wrote the unit tests using the Jest JavaScript testing framework and the React Native Testing Library.
- I manually tested all the features of the mobile application by interacting with it both on a real iOS device and an Android emulator. This proved to be a much more practical and reliable way of testing given the small scale of our application.
- I built the mobile application for the Android platform by generating an .apk file using the Expo Application Services. This proved to be much more challenging than initially expected as each build of the application would take more than 10 minutes, and each build of the application would crash as soon as it was run even after a tremendous number of tries.

### Yusuf Aygün

1. **Responsibilities**: In this milestone, I was responsible for enhancing backend architecture, implementing and refining database models, creating and maintaining API endpoints, managing the functionality for games and comments, writing comprehensive unit tests, and addressing key backend issues to improve performance and reliability.

2. **Main contributions**:
- **API Development**:
  - Developed two key endpoints for managing game comments:
    - **Add Game Comment**: Allows authenticated users to comment on specific game positions.
    - **List Game Comments**: Fetches all comments for a specific game.
- **Backend Improvements**:
  - Added a `title` field to the post model to enhance post functionality.
  - Modified the `filter_games` endpoint to include `game_id` in the response for better frontend integration.
- **Testing**:
  - Wrote and configured unit tests for multiple endpoints, including posts, likes, and comments.
  - Resolved database and configuration-related issues to ensure smooth test execution.


3. **API Contributions**:
**Endpoint Name**: Add Game Comment  
**Description**: This API allows authenticated users to add comments on specific positions in a game. The comment includes a `position_fen` string, optional related `comment_fens`, and a `comment_text`.  
**Example Call**:
```bash
POST /api/v1/games/{game_id}/comments/
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "position_fen": "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR",
    "comment_fens": ["rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR"],
    "comment_text": "Great move!"
}
```
Example Response:

```bash
{
    "id": 1,
    "user": "testuser",
    "game": 5,
    "position_fen": "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR",
    "comment_fens": "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR",
    "fens_list": ["rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR"],
    "comment_text": "Great move!",
    "created_at": "2024-11-22T12:00:00Z"
}
```
Usage Scenario: This endpoint is used in the project to allow users to comment on specific moves or positions of a chess game, contributing to a richer discussion experience around game analysis.
